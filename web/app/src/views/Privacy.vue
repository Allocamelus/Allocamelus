            Basic account information: If you register on this server, you may
            be asked to enter a username, an e-mail address and a password. You
            may also enter additional profile information such as a display name
            and biography, and upload a profile picture. The username, display
            name, biography, profile picture are always listed publicly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Posts, following and other public information: The list of people
            you follow is listed publicly, the same is true for your followers.
            When you submit a message, the date and time is stored as well as
            the application you submitted the message from. Messages may contain
            media attachments, such as pictures and videos. Public and unlisted
            posts are available publicly. When you feature a post on your
            profile, that is also publicly available information. Your posts are
            delivered to your followers, in some cases it means they are
            delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. When you
            delete posts, this is likewise delivered to your followers. The
            action of reblogging or favouriting another post is always public.
          </li>
          <li>
            Direct and followers-only posts: All posts are stored and processed
            on the server. Followers-only posts are delivered to your followers
            and users who are mentioned in them, and direct posts are delivered
            only to users mentioned in them. In some cases it means they are
            delivered to different servers and copies are stored there. We make
            a good faith effort to limit the access to those posts only to
            authorized persons, but other servers may fail to do so. Therefore
            it's important to review servers your followers belong to. You may
            toggle an option to approve and reject new followers manually in the
            settings. Please keep in mind that the operators of the server and
            any receiving server may view such messages, and that recipients may
            screenshot, copy or otherwise re-share them. Do not share any
            dangerous information over {{ siteName }}.

            revocation in the settings. The latest IP address used is stored for
            up to 12 months. We also may retain server logs which include the IP
            address of every request to our server.
